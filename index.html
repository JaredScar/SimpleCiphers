        <h1>What is Encryption?</h1>
        <p>In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized
            parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.
            Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.
            In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an
            encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. For technical reasons,
            an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible
            to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational
            resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the
            originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.

        <h1>What are Ciphers?</h1>
        <p>In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined
            steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is
            to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a
            set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

            Codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the
            same number of characters as are input. There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer,
            characters when output versus the number that were input.

            Codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers
            to a word or phrase. For example, "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates." When using
            a cipher the original information is known as plaintext, and the encrypted form as ciphertext. The ciphertext message
            contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.

                <p id="caesar">
                    The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a cipher in
                    which uses a shift to encrypt its messages. For instance, a right shift of 3 would make any "A"s in the message
                    a "D". The Caesar cipher was used by Julius Caesar (whom it is also named after) in his private correspondence.
                    The Caesar cipher in modern practice is easily broken and offers no communications security. The key to this
                    cipher is to know how much to shift. There is only 25 possible shifts, therefore it's quite simple for a
                    modern day computer to figure out in milliseconds...

                <p id="rail-fence">
                    The Rail-Fence cipher (sometimes referred to as the zigzag cipher) is a form of a transposition cipher. The name
                    comes from the way in which the encryption of it's messages are encoded. The letters of the messages are written
                    in zigzags up and down an X amount of rows and each row is part of the final encryption scheme. The key to figuring out
                    the encrypted message is by knowing how many rails (rows) there are. The amount of rails will always be higher than 2, but
                    no more than the number of letters in the encrypted text. This cipher is therefore not very strong and can be solved
                    by hand...

                <p id="vigenere">
                    The Vigenère cipher is a technique of encrypting messages by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based
                    on the letters of a keyword. This cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it also resisted all attempts
                    to break it for three centuries...The cipher stood strong until 1863 when a man by the name of Friedrich Kasiski
                    was the first to publish a successful attack on it. Kasiski had noticed that he could take advantage of the fact
                    that repeated words are, by chance, sometimes encrypted using the same key letters, thus leading to repeated
                    groups in the encrypted messages. By counting the distance between the repetitions of a group of encrypted message,
                    Kasiski realized that this could imply the key length that the encryption had used. The Vigenère cipher, with normal alphabets,
                    essentially uses modulo arithmetic, which is commutative. Therefore, if the key length is known (or guessed), subtracting the
                    cipher text from itself, offset by the key length, will produce the plain text encrypted with itself. If any "probable word"
                    in the plain text is known or can be guessed, its self-encryption can be recognized, which allows recovery of the key
                    by subtracting the known plaintext from the cipher text. Key elimination is especially useful against short messages.

                <p id="substitution">
                    A Substitution cipher is a technique of encrypting messages by substituting the letters of a message with a different value.
                    We will be focusing on the simple substitution cipher in which the letters of a message are replaced by a single different letter.
                    For instance, setting A to Z, B to F, G to I, etc. These are completely random and have no "shift" and/or 1 single key. Instead,
                    this cipher requires a full-out key to be correctly solved in which you need the key to each single letter to decipher
                    the message encrypted. This cipher is still not very strong and is easily broken in modern day practice. The most
                    common deduction to this problem is analyzing the frequency distribution of the encrypted message. This allows formation
                    of partial words and therefore can in-turn gain the hacker more words by using the somewhat filled key.
