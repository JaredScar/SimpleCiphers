    <h1>What is Encryption?</h1>
    <p>In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized
        parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.
        Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.
        In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an
        encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. For technical reasons,
        an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible
        to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational
        resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the
        originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.

    <h1>What are Ciphers?</h1>
    <p>In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined
        steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is
        to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a
        set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

        Codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the
        same number of characters as are input. There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer,
        characters when output versus the number that were input.

        Codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers
        to a word or phrase. For example, "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates." When using
        a cipher the original information is known as plaintext, and the encrypted form as ciphertext. The ciphertext message
        contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.
